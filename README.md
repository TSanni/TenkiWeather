# Tenki Weather üå§Ô∏è

[Tenki Weather](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tenki-weather/id6451055649) is an iOS project that was inspired by Google and Samsung's applications for Android Devices. Using that inspiration, I have created a full-fledged weather application for iOS devices. Version 4 is available for download now in the App Store. 

[Tenki Weather](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tenki-weather/id6451055649) was made with SwiftUI as a focus. Only using UIKit where necessary. On top of that, this project contains many features that are core to building great iOS applications. Below, you'll find a list of the most important frameworks, libraries, and APIs used to create this app. 

## Recent Updates
