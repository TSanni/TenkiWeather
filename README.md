# Tenki Weather üå§Ô∏è

As a person who has owned an Android phone, I really grew to love Google's weather app. Unfortunately, when I moved over to iPhone, I could no longer use Google‚Äôs weather app because it seemed to be exclusive to Android devices. 

The UI and ease of use was just unrivaled in my opinion. That‚Äôs when I realized that it is software, written in code. And as an iOS Developer, I could just make my own version and publish it on the App Store. 

Introducing [Tenki Weather](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tenki-weather/id6451055649), the weather app for iOS devices that has a very similar design to Google‚Äôs weather app but with a few different features. This app was built from scratch using SwiftUI and also implements a few UIKit components using the UIView/UIViewController Representable protocol. Take a look at the many features used to create this app below and also view a demo. 

Plus you can also download [Tenki Weather](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tenki-weather/id6451055649) in the App Store right now! Version 2 is currently available with big changes!
