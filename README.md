# Tenki Weather üå§Ô∏è

[Tenki Weather](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tenki-weather/id6451055649) is an iOS project that was inspired by Google and Samsung's applications for Android Devices. Using that inspiration, I have created a full-fledged weather application for iOS devices. Version 4 is available for download now in the App Store. 

[Tenki Weather](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tenki-weather/id6451055649) was made with SwiftUI as a focus. Only using UIKit where necessary. On top of that, this project contains many features that are core to building great iOS applications. Below, you'll find a list of the most important frameworks, libraries, and APIs used to create this app. 

## Recent Updates
This app has gone through a major redesign since it's inception and first publication to the app store. It has been updated to use Spritkit for cool snow and rain effects, most of the UI has been completely reimagined, and the source code has been cleaned up.
